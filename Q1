###Problem Statement
#Write a script which keeps track of the first and last user who used the
#system every wednesday. The entries should be saved in a file named “Wed.txt”
#under two columns “User_Name” and “Time_In”.
#When the total number of entries in this file reach 50 find out the user with the
#maximum number of entries

##Solution---

#This code will extract the information of first and last user who used the system on that day and save the first and last name to 
#file wed.txt, using crontab it will run on only wednesday at 23:59 every week so only data of wednesday will get save into the wed.txt

touch wed.txt
var=1
touch v
last -R>v

while read line
do
touch file1
echo "$line">file1
day=$(awk '{print $5}' file1)
name=$(awk '{print $1}' file1)
regrex="^([0-9])"
if [[ $day =~ $regrex ]]
then
d=$(date +%e)
if [ $d -eq $day ]
then
if [ $var == 1 ]
then
data=$(awk '{print $1,$6}' file1)
echo "$data">>wed.txt            #It will save the first entry of that day
fi
var=$var+1
data=$(awk '{print $1,$6}' file1)
fi
fi
done<v

echo "$data">>wed.txt        #It will save the last entry of that day.
li=$(wc -l<wed.txt)
if [ $li -gt 50 ]
then
echo "wed.txt is having more than 50 entries"
user=$(cat wed.txt|tr " " "\n"|sort|uniq -c|sort -bnr|head -n 1)
echo "Name of the user which is having maximum entries ------$user"
else
echo "file is having $li entries"
fi
